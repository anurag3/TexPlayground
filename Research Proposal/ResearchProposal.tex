	\section{Introduction}
	
	Need of 3D Mapping in Self Driving 
	
	How Self driving requires more data than just the data provided by GNSS
	
	\section{Literature Review}

	Different Mapping Techniques:
	
	1. Visual Mapping
	
	2. Lidar Mapping
	
	Use of HDFS for data association of Lat Long with Digital Markers
	
	\section{Research Methodology}
	Developing a system comprising of 2 parts:
	
	On-Vehicle: for Data Recording
	
	Online Platform: for putting together the data recorded and generating a map of it
	
	\section{Conclusion}
